# Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

**What kind of profiles are you looking for?**

None! All of them! Any of them! The European Union is about diversity (after all, its motto is “united in diversity”), so just be yourself! We’re not looking for a specific type of profile; we’re looking for the best combination to make MEU Paris a unique experience.

**What will the topics be?**

Participants in MEU Paris will discuss two topics that are at the core of our Union and what it is trying to achieve: a profound reform of its institutions and its way of life, and an effective protection of the environment and of the interests of European consumers.  The agenda will thus be shared between whistleblowers protection and gas supply security.

**What are the participation fees for MEU Paris?**

We want MEU Paris to be accessible to as many people as possible, and as a stay in Paris is expensive on its own, we decided to have a total fee of… 0€!

**What will be included in MEU Paris?**

As we decided not to have participants pay for MEU Paris, what we will be providing to participants depends on the additional resources of funding we will be able to find and of the partnerships we will be able to forge. We will keep participants informed about all the perks that will be available to them during the conference as we secure funding.

**What about accommodation?**

Finding accommodation in Paris is not an easy thing. Finding cheap accommodation is even more difficult. We’re working on brokering partnerships with youth hostels in the city to provide participants with suggestions and rebates for booking their own stay. If our resources allow, we want to offer a refund of accommodation fees of up to 150€ to all our participants. There again, they will be kept in touch with any new development in this matter.

**Where will MEU Paris take place?**

Our venue is to be announced soon! Stay tuned and follow us on our social media accounts to be the first one to find out. One thing for sure: we want our venue to be a tremendous one, and we’re working tirelessly to that end! It will be central enough in Paris and accessible by Metro, Bus and suburban train.

**I need a visa to get to France, how can you help?**

There is a dedicated question in the application form. If you need a visa, we will issue an official invitation letter along with your acceptation notification at the end of the application period.

**I can’t upload my file on the form, what should I do?**

You can send it at participants.model.eu.paris@gmail.com, we will add it to your application.

**I want to go to MEU Paris, but I also love the idea of going to MEU Lisbon. What should I do?**

Don’t you worry! If you feel like it and want to try not one but two weeks in the MEU world, nothing prevents you from taking part in both! MEU Paris ends the day MEU Lisbon participants are supposed to arrive, so you can use the 8th to make the trip.

# Roles presentation

**Member of the European Parliament**

Members of the European Parliament are the directly elected representatives of the European people. Whether they work in Brussels’ Committee rooms or Strasbourg’s plenary session room, the 751 MEPs represent more than 500 million European citizens.

If you are selected as an MEP you will be part of the biggest legislative body of the Union, with both a country of election and a political faction, of which you’ll be part during the simulation. As such you’ll have to defend not only the ideas of your faction (social-democrats, liberals, conservatives, nationalists…), but also the interest of your country of origin and the people there who elected you.

Being an MEP gives you the opportunity to live the full experience of a European lawmaker, from backroom deals to fiery speeches in plenary session, from building coalitions to trying to make a whole discussion fail. It’s a demanding but fulfilling role to take on!

**Minister in the Council of the European Union**

The Council of the European Union (or just “the Council”) is the other legislative body of the European Union, and for long, before the Lisbon Treaty, it was the most important, being the only one to decide on much of the policies of the Union. The Council is the place where the diverging interests of 28 Member States eventually, through harsh negotiations, converge and give life to EU law… Or many time just remain impossible to conciliate.

If you are selected as a Minister of the Council, you will be a key player of the political field, a member of the national government of the country you will be attributed. These high-ranking elected official are in charge of carrying the interests of their national government, their political family, but most importantly to appease the public opinion back home.

Being a Minister can make you a powerful player in the permanent negotiation game that are European politics, as the vote (and public declarations) of even the smallest Member States often wields more power than the vote of any MEP.

**Journalist**

As every political organisation, the European Union is made of public policies and administrative decisions, but also of shady backroom deals and a complex web of relationships. And just as every political organisation, the Union has a deep love-hate relationship with the press.

Love, because wouldn’t the press be here to report on the job they do, European lawmakers would find themselves with no means to express their deeds, their policies and their decisions to the European citizens who elected them in the first place. Hate, because the job they do often has a least pleasant side, a “House of Cards” side that they don’t want exposed.

Being a journalist in MEU Paris, you will have the chance to experience for a few days the excitement of working to unveil the secrets of European politics, trying to report on hard-earned coalition making in the Parliament, conflict between Ministers arising in the Council or the discrete but effective undercover actions of Lobbyists.

**Lobbyists**

The European Union would not be complete without an essential but often undercover actor: lobbyism. Although policy-making is the job of Ministers and MEPs, all actors of the society are trying to have their voices heard in the halls of powers. Some have huge financial resources and make a strategic and extensive use of their powers of persuasion, starting with the representatives of the European economic world. Others struggle to carry the voices of citizens with little to no resources and nothing but soft power to use.

As a Lobbyist, your role would be to defend the interest of the organisation you’re representing, either by convincing lawmakers to introduce changes that would advantage your company or your NGO, by short-circuiting similar initiatives from representatives of other interests or by trying to score goodwill points with lawmakers in helping them advance their agenda, in the hope that they will return the favour eventually.

Without Lobbyists, European politics are just a game of negotiation and compromise making. With lobbyist, a different way of taking into account the citizens’ opinion comes into the equation.
