The Association of Diplomacy in Practice was founded in 2007 by students of the Corvinus University of Budapest to balance out the limits of theoretical education. By now, our association has expanded the variety of its programs and has become the College for Advanced Studies of Diplomacy in Practice (CASDP). The purpose of our Collegeâ€™s effective operation is not simply to gain academic knowledge, but to retain practical experience in the field of foreign relations and diplomacy.


At the College for Advanced Studies of Diplomacy in Practice we believe that practical education is not only necessary, but quite indispensable for achieving future goals in the professional field. The organized and even multiple programs enable students to improve their practical skills by representing robust aspiration. According to the philosophy of our College, this unique opportunity is incomparable to university studies and has a profound importance to ensure its appropriate functioning.
