The European Youth Parliament (EYP) Ireland is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation that runs a number of weekend long conferences every year for young people. EYP Ireland is one of 40 national committees of the EYP network,  organises almost 1.500 days of EYP activity every year, involving close to 35.000 participants. Thousands of young people are active as volunteers all over Europe, making EYP a programme truly for young people, by young people. It is our mission in EYP Ireland to develop an interest in European issues in young people in Ireland. We seek to empower the youth to question the world around them and come up with innovative solutions to global problems, while emphasising concepts of cooperation and respect. It is with great pleasure that we invite you to join us in this mission, and let the voices of our young people be heard.
