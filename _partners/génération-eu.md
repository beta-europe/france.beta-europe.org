« Generation UE » is a project led by students from Strasbourg. Our goal is to make young people from 16 to 30 give their opinion on a wide range of topics such as their sense of belonging to Europe, the importance of the EU in their daily lives, their attachment to their rights as EU citizens or their personal analysis on EU’s present and future. We believe every young European we met is legitimate to talk about the EU and the European construction, with his/her own words and notwithstanding he/she’s familiar with the topic. We want young people to feel confident enough to debate about Europe, and we foster critical thinking. 

Since September 2015, our team has conducted more than 90 interviews to realise a 35-minute webdocumentary and a shorter version (15 minutes). We have already organized more than 12 projections of our webdocumentary. They were followed by great debates with youngsters. Moreover, we have recently added a platform to share how we find information on European affairs.
