The Israeli Model United Nations Association (IMUNA) has grown from a non-profit umbrella organization representing 12 Model UN Societies in universities and colleges nationwide, to a recognized nonprofit organization (NGO) devoted to the promotion of the next generation of diplomatic leaders in Israel. The organization facilitates various programs that enable students and young professionals to enhance their skills and experience in the fields of public speaking, conflict resolution, decision-making and negotiations through debate, workshops, and seminars, and aims to instill a passion for diplomacy along with the tools required to work in the field. Besides traditional Model UN programs, IMUNA facilitates many other academic and social programs, some aim exclusively for Model UN students and others are open to the general public.  These programs include seminars at the Israeli Knesset, the delegation of the European Union and foreign embassies, meet-up events with leading diplomats and the participation in official delegations on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

The Organization itself is led by individuals who've completed their Model UN training and wish to help others achieve similar goals. The organization is managed by a robust team of 50 individuals who lead the various branches of the organization in the different campuses as well as an executive body leading the entire organization. Ambitious students and young professionals are always invited to take a more active leadership role within the organization, assisting their peers while developing their own leadership skills
