The United Nations Youth Association of Albania (UN Youth Albania) is a youth-led NGO dedicated to inform, inspire and mobilize Albanian youth and Albanian citizens, in general, to support and promote the values and activities of the United Nations.  It started as a project in October 2016, when a diverse group of young Albanians passionate about youth engagement and the works of the United Nations, decided to join their experiences and efforts to create and foster a UN youth community in their country. 

UN Youth Albanianâ€™s main mission is to bring young people closer to the UN and the UN closer to the youth. Through projects such as seminars, webinars, workshops, conferences and simulations of the international decision-making bodies, UNYAA aims to promote the ideas of the UN, to spread the word about the SDGs while encouraging initiatives that contribute to the achievement of these goals, to serve as a tool for non-formal education of young people and to foster the spirit of cooperation and volunteerism. We work to create a youth-led flexible structure without unnecessary hierarchical divisions and to become internationally involved thus lending young Albanians a voice on the global stage.
